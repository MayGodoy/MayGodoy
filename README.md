### Hi! 😄
I am a young Argentinian who migrated to Barcelona ✈️ and in the process, I discovered my passion for technology 💻. After years of studying architecture and design, I realized that I had always been passionate about data and development 📚. So during the confinement, I started to study Python in a self-taught way, and then I studied at the Data Science at all women. 

I’m currently working on projects as Junior ML Engineer 💻. I would like to work as Data Analyst for that reason I'm studying Business Intelligence. 📊 I keep doing courses and taking classes because I love learning. I'm committed to improving my work and my skills every day. Right now I'm taking a course about BI, Cloud Services, and Spark. My dream  is work in the Smart Cities field 🏢.
